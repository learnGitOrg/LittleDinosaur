娱乐作为人类生命活动中不可或缺的一部分，自太古洪荒便开始以长盛不衰的生命力发展着，跨过千年岁月来到如今，高度信息化的时代催生出了无数繁复多样的娱乐方式，从宏伟辉煌的网络游戏狂欢到如日中天的短视频平台，还有深不可测的单机游戏世界供给我们探索，可以说，任何拥有现代电子设备的打工人都是不应该缺乏娱乐方式的。
然而，这些娱乐方式都或多或少有着一些缺点。
想像一下在你辛勤劳作了一整天之后打开英雄联盟想要在召唤师峡谷来一场酣畅淋漓的战斗放松一下进入游戏却发现下路和辅助因为一个兵骂了起来在一番污言秽语之后两人双双挂机而你纵使以自己精湛的技术在对位上碾压对手奈何双拳难敌四手在一番负隅顽抗后依然无能为力输掉比赛退出到比赛结算界面一看原来自己已经十二连败顺便掉了个段。对于一个已然身心疲惫，满心期待着通过网络游戏来放松一下的打工人来说，这会对他的心灵造成多么巨大的伤害啊！

通过上面的例子可以看出，选择网络游戏作为娱乐方式的一大缺点就是它提供的服务是不稳定的，即无法确保用户通过此方式能得到放松，甚至有概率对用户造成伤害，这显然是一个无法忽视的巨大缺陷。
不仅是网络游戏，其他娱乐方式也多多少少包含着一些难以忽视的问题，短视频纵使能以小段的信息片段吸引用户不断看下去，但高质量作品的缺乏却会导致用户往往在结束观看后感觉自己在浪费时间——“我花了这么多时间看了个什么玩意儿啊！”进而萌发罪恶感；而单机游戏引以为傲的游戏性在另一方面亦提高了用户的上手难度，且其动辄数十小时的游戏时长也很容易让打工人望而却步。
总的来说，服务不稳定，趣味不足，需要花费大块时间可以说是当前大部分娱乐方式的通病。

那么有没有一种既简单又稳定还不需要特意去花费时间与精力的娱乐方式供打工人选择呢？

我们从几个软件内置的小游戏中找到了灵感。
Chrome，谷歌旗下浏览器，作为一款浏览器来说它的确是十分优秀的，但让我总是选择使用这款浏览器的原因却是因为其内置的小游戏。如果我们在断网的情况下打开chrome，我们便会发现在断网提示上方出现了一个像素小恐龙，倘若此时按下空格键，恐龙前方的道路便会延伸出去，一款简单的二维像素风跑酷游戏就这样开始了。这是一个非常简单有效的设计：用户不必特意去启动游戏，这显然极大地降低了对用户的启动性的要求（用户不必特意去思考自己应该去玩什么，而只需要选择是否要玩）而另一方面，它也准确地抓住了用户需求：断网时往往正是用户无事可做之时，那此时又有谁能够拒绝这样一款已经自动打开等待游玩的游戏呢？这甚至为这款浏览器平添了一丝人文关怀：即便是断网了这款浏览器也能以某种方式服务用户。当然，这款小游戏也满足了作为一款游戏的基本要求：它简单而有趣，可爱的像素小恐龙更是让人讨厌不起来。
在安卓7.0之后，如果连续点击版本号，安卓手机的任务栏中会出现一个新的图标——一个名为empty dish的碟子，在点击之后，会出现四个食物选项：bits fish chicken treat，在选择其中一种食物之后，empty dish就会被替换为这种食物，这个彩蛋到此似乎就结束了——然而事实并非如此。在一段不确定的时间之后，用户的手机会收到一条信息：A cat is here! 点击通知，用户会进入一个界面，里面会展示用户得到的小猫——原来这是一个用食物钓猫的游戏！它是如此的简单，以至于用户需要的操作时间不超过五秒，它也不需要额外花费用户的精力，用户只需放好食物等待猫猫上钩，时间的不确定性也弹性地限制用户不必特意进行等待，但它却能给用户带来一点难能可贵的惊喜与情趣：用户获得的每一只猫都是独一无二的，它有着唯一的编号，有着独一无二的花纹，用户还能对每一只猫进行命名和分享，这与前面的小恐龙游戏是异曲同工的——简单，有趣，可爱。

聊了这么多之后，终于要回到正题了：我们究竟想要做一个怎样的产品？

简单来说，这是一款桌面宠物，暂定名为Little Rabbit。以下是我们当前想要实现的功能：

在大部分情况下，它只会隐藏在后台，但在特殊情况下（诸如断网，用户长时间未操作），它会从角落中蹦出来，请求与用户互动，用户可以通过简单的操作与它进行游戏。

Product vision:
This product is designed to allow every working stiff to enjoy simple pleasure during drudgery. 

The inspiration of this product derives from the build-in game “Dinosaur Parkour” in Chrome and build-in Easter Egg cat-fishing game in Android. 

Entertainment, as an indispensable part of human life activities, has been developing with long-lasting vitality since the ancient times. Across the millennium, the era of information has spawned numerous complex and diverse entertainment methods, from the magnificent and brilliant online game carnival to the prosperous short video platform, not to mention the unfathomable single game world for us to explore. There is no doubt that any working stiff with modern electronic equipment should be entertained. 

Yet, these sorts of entertainment mentioned above have some disadvantages to a certain extent. 

Imagine opening the League of heroes after a long day, hoping to have a thrilling and delightful fight in Summoner Canyon to chill out. After entering the game, you find the ADC and SUP are arguing over a minion in a foul language and then both hang up. Even if you crush your opponent with your exquisite skills, you can't beat four hands with two fists. You can do nothing but lose the game after a desperate fight. Exited to the game settlement interface, it turns out that he has lost 12 games in a row, and dropped a paragraph by the way. For a productive member of society who has already been physically and mentally exhausted and is looking forward to relaxing through online games, what great harm will this do to his soul!

From the example above, we can see that one of the major disadvantages of choosing online games as entertainment is that the services it provides are unstable, that is, it cannot ensure that users can be relaxed through this way with the potential of causing harm to users, which is obviously a huge defect that cannot be ignored.

It is difficult to ignore the problems occurred not only in online games, but also in other forms of entertainment. Although short videos can attract users’ eyes to watch them with fragmental information, the lack of high-quality works will make users feel that they are wasting their time. "what did I spend so much time watching?" they tend to have a sense of guilt after a binge. Moreover, the gameplay of stand-alone games, which they are proud of, also adds up the burden for users to get started. Moreover, the hours of game time that they need to spend deter working stiffs.

Generally speaking, unstable service, boredom and the need to spend a large amount of time can be the common fault of most of current entertainment methods.

So is there a simple and stable way of entertainment that we don't need to spend much time and energy on?

We found our inspiration in a few games built in the software. 

Chrome, Google's browser, is really excellent as a browser. Yet the reason I always choose to use this browser is because it has a built-in small game. If we open chrome when we are disconnected from the Internet, we will find a small pixel dinosaur above the disconnection prompt. If you press the space bar, the road ahead of the dinosaur will extend out, and a simple two-dimensional pixel wind Parkour game begins. This is a very simple and effective design: users don't have to start the game deliberately, which obviously greatly reduces the requirements for users to start (users don't have to think about what they should play, but only need to choose whether to play). On the other hand, it also accurately grasps the user's needs: being disconnected from the internet and having nothing to do, who can turn off such a game that has been automatically opened for playing at this time? The dinosaur even adds a touch of humanity to the browser: it can serve users in some way even if it's disconnected. Meanwhile, this small game also meets the basic requirements of a game: it is simple and interesting, and the pixel small dinosaur is quite adorable.

After Android 7.0, if you click the version number continuously, a new icon will appear in the taskbar of Android phone - a dish named “empty dish”. After clicking, four food options appear: bits, fish, chicken, treat. After selecting one of the foods, empty dish will be replaced with it, and the Easter Egg seems to come to an end - but it's not. After an uncertain period of time, the user's mobile phone will receive a message: a cat is here! Click the notification, and the user will enter an interface, which will display the kitten the user has got - it turns out that this is a cat fishing game! It is so simple that users need no more than five seconds’ operation time, and it does not need to spend extra energy. Users only need to offer food and wait for the cat to bite. The uncertainty limits users' waiting time flexibly, bringing a little precious surprise and interest to users. Every cat that users get is unique: it has a unique id and unique patterns. Users can name and share each cat, which is similar to the previous small dinosaur game - simple, interesting and cute.

Let’s we go back to the point: what kind of product do we want to make?
In short, the product is a desktop pet, tentatively named little dinosaur. Here's what we want to do right now. 
In most cases, it will only be hidden in the background, but in special cases (such as disconnection, users have not operated for a long time), it will jump out of the corner, request to interact with users, and users can play games with it through simple operation.
