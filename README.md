Product vision:
This product is designed to allow every working stiff to enjoy simple pleasure during drudgery. 

The inspiration of this product derives from the build-in game “Dinosaur Parkour” in Chrome and build-in Easter Egg cat-fishing game in Android. 

Entertainment, as an indispensable part of human life activities, has been developing with long-lasting vitality since the ancient times. Across the millennium, the era of information has spawned numerous complex and diverse entertainment methods, from the magnificent and brilliant online game carnival to the prosperous short video platform, not to mention the unfathomable single game world for us to explore. There is no doubt that any working stiff with modern electronic equipment should be entertained. 

Yet, these sorts of entertainment mentioned above have some disadvantages to a certain extent. 

Imagine opening the League of heroes after a long day, hoping to have a thrilling and delightful fight in Summoner Canyon to chill out. After entering the game, you find the ADC and SUP are arguing over a minion in a foul language and then both hang up. Even if you crush your opponent with your exquisite skills, you can't beat four hands with two fists. You can do nothing but lose the game after a desperate fight. Exited to the game settlement interface, it turns out that he has lost 12 games in a row, and dropped a paragraph by the way. For a productive member of society who has already been physically and mentally exhausted and is looking forward to relaxing through online games, what great harm will this do to his soul!

From the example above, we can see that one of the major disadvantages of choosing online games as entertainment is that the services it provides are unstable, that is, it cannot ensure that users can be relaxed through this way with the potential of causing harm to users, which is obviously a huge defect that cannot be ignored.

It is difficult to ignore the problems occurred not only in online games, but also in other forms of entertainment. Although short videos can attract users’ eyes to watch them with fragmental information, the lack of high-quality works will make users feel that they are wasting their time. "what did I spend so much time watching?" they tend to have a sense of guilt after a binge. Moreover, the gameplay of stand-alone games, which they are proud of, also adds up the burden for users to get started. Moreover, the hours of game time that they need to spend deter working stiffs.

Generally speaking, unstable service, boredom and the need to spend a large amount of time can be the common fault of most of current entertainment methods.

So is there a simple and stable way of entertainment that we don't need to spend much time and energy on?

We found our inspiration in a few games built in the software. 

Chrome, Google's browser, is really excellent as a browser. Yet the reason I always choose to use this browser is because it has a built-in small game. If we open chrome when we are disconnected from the Internet, we will find a small pixel dinosaur above the disconnection prompt. If you press the space bar, the road ahead of the dinosaur will extend out, and a simple two-dimensional pixel wind Parkour game begins. This is a very simple and effective design: users don't have to start the game deliberately, which obviously greatly reduces the requirements for users to start (users don't have to think about what they should play, but only need to choose whether to play). On the other hand, it also accurately grasps the user's needs: being disconnected from the internet and having nothing to do, who can turn off such a game that has been automatically opened for playing at this time? The dinosaur even adds a touch of humanity to the browser: it can serve users in some way even if it's disconnected. Meanwhile, this small game also meets the basic requirements of a game: it is simple and interesting, and the pixel small dinosaur is quite adorable.

After Android 7.0, if you click the version number continuously, a new icon will appear in the taskbar of Android phone - a dish named “empty dish”. After clicking, four food options appear: bits, fish, chicken, treat. After selecting one of the foods, empty dish will be replaced with it, and the Easter Egg seems to come to an end - but it's not. After an uncertain period of time, the user's mobile phone will receive a message: a cat is here! Click the notification, and the user will enter an interface, which will display the kitten the user has got - it turns out that this is a cat fishing game! It is so simple that users need no more than five seconds’ operation time, and it does not need to spend extra energy. Users only need to offer food and wait for the cat to bite. The uncertainty limits users' waiting time flexibly, bringing a little precious surprise and interest to users. Every cat that users get is unique: it has a unique id and unique patterns. Users can name and share each cat, which is similar to the previous small dinosaur game - simple, interesting and cute.

Let’s we go back to the point: what kind of product do we want to make?
In short, the product is a desktop pet, tentatively named Little Rabbit. Here's what we want to do right now. 
In most cases, it will only be hidden in the background, but in special cases (such as disconnection, users have not operated for a long time), it will jump out of the corner, request to interact with users, and users can play games with it through simple operation.
